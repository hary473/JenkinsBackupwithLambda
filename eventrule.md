Here are the steps to set up a CloudWatch Events rule to trigger the Lambda function daily at a specific time:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CloudWatch Dashboard.
2. Click on "Rules" in the left-hand menu and then click the "Create rule" button.
3. In the "Event Source" section, select "Schedule" and then enter a cron expression to specify the time and frequency of the event. For example, to run the Lambda function every day at 6:00 AM UTC, you can use the following expression: 0 6 * * ? *.
4. In the "Targets" section, click the "Add target" button and then select "Lambda function" as the target type.
5. Choose your Lambda function from the dropdown list and click the "Configure details" button.
6. Enter a name and description for the CloudWatch Events rule, and then click the "Create rule" button.
7. Now, the Lambda function will be triggered automatically at the specified time every day to create a snapshot of your Jenkins master server. You can check the CloudWatch Logs to monitor the execution of your Lambda function and ensure that it is running as expected. Note that you may need to adjust the cron expression or other settings to fit your specific requirements.
